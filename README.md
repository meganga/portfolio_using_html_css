# My first portfolio using html and css.

It is a part of my journey to learn web development technologies.The html page is made using only css and no external libraries.

## Technologies Used:



 1. Visual Studio: To write all the HTML and the CSS code.
 - Pakages used:	 			
					 - Prettier: To take care of the indentation and maintaining the structure of the code.
					 - open in browse: To open file in a browse more easily.

2. Vecter:       To design the various sections of the web page.
